# Cognition_WordHunt

This project is made for the cognition hackathon. This in simple terms, is a language helper(getting the appropriate word in a given situation). 
We are trying to create a website which tries to tell the approximately accurate word if we know what are we trying to say but are not able to put it together.
We will also try to add support for different languages in later stages. We will also try to make them remind continuously after an interval of time what did they
search and learn in a previous time frame.
Basically the objective is to help people(mostly children and students) in concising a statement that also looks attractive and professional.

Majorly, basic web development will be used.
